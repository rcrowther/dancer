= Tutorial
Dancer makes files representing dance moves which can then generate representations like a musical score, or be run in rendering engines to animate the moves. 

== Intro
How to use Dancer.

=== Compiling
The process of assembling, processing, and using an input file.

==== Entering input
Heres some input,

      clap
      clap overhead
      step west

When put through ''dancerc', this will produce a file ''test.dnc'. This file can be used to create directions, like sheet music,



or run an animation.


==== Program to use for input
You use a text editor. Any will do. In Windows operating systems, you could use Wordpad. Don't use a word processor like Libreoffice or Microsoft ''Word' (unless you know what you are doing).

If you get offered the choice, ''dancer' programs are standardised to ''UTF-8' encoding. Your code will probably work anyway.


==== Commandline
Create a ''test.dn' file,

\score
  \staff
    :dancerName "albert"
    {
      clap
      clap overhead
      step west
    }

Run,

dancerc test.dn

You do not have to have ''dancerc' installed. If you do not, go to the ''dancerc' directory, then,

./dancerc.py test.dn

This will result in a file called ''test.dnc'.

You can do several actions with this file, but the simplest is to run,

dancerPDF test.dnc

Which should result in a file,

test.pdf

Which you can view.


=== Making a file
Some basics about writing files.

==== Notation
Moves,

   twirl
   clap overhead

Note all moves are on seperate lines.

Note also that moves may have words after them which modify how the action is done. There can be many modifiers. How a move is classified is the result of extensive theory and work in Dancer, but you do not need to worry about this now.

Moves often have automatic values, and these can be useful,

clap

is the same as ''clap mid'

Moves can last longer than one beat. Put a number after them,

   circle 2 arm

Rests are a special move. They use the single letter 'r'. This is builtin to dancer. To rest for a bar

   r 4

Time signature is not subdivided as in sheet music. Use the \beatsPerBar command,

  \beatsPerBar 3

And speed, ''tempo' is also set by a command. The number is beats per minute,

   \tempo 60

Both time and tempo marks can be placed anywhere is the stream of instructions, changing the value at that point.

Her we go, laying out some basic moves,

{
    \beatsPerBar 3
    \tempo 50
    step S
    step W
    step S
}
