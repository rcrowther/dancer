= Event stream format
Events are classed,

CreateContext
DeleteContext
MergeProperty
DeleteProperty
MomentStart
MomentEnd
DanceEvent
Finish


== File start
Moment 0 is assumed to be previous to anything happening. So the head,
- Assumes moment 0,
: ...so requires no wrap in MomentStart/MomentEnd
- should contain no DanceEvent(s)
: not an error, but ignored. Ignoring is not guarenteed
- Will conclude on MomentStart(1)

== File end
Moment is irrelevant. so the tail,
- Assumes no moment
: ...so requires no wrap in MomentStart/MomentEnd
- should contain no DanceEvent(s)
: not an error, but ignored. Ignoring is not guarenteed
- Must conclude on a Finish
: last command in a list of events


== As text
When written to a text file, each event should be on a line


== Example
CreateContext(0, 2, "Score")
CreateContext(2, 3, "Dancer")
CreateContext(2, 4, "Dancer")
MergeProperty(0, performer, Bacup)
MergeProperty(0, title, Coconutters)
MergeProperty(0, style, clog)
MergeProperty(0, beatsPerBar, 4)
MergeProperty(0, dancers, 3)
MergeProperty(0, date, )
MergeProperty(0, tempo, 120)
MergeProperty(2, dancerName, Albert)
MomentStart(1)
BarlineEvent(3, '')
MoveEvent(3, clap, 1, [])
BarlineEvent(4, '')
MoveEvent(4, clap, 1, [])
MomentEnd()
MomentStart(2)
MoveEvent(3, clap, 1, ['overhead'])
MoveEvent(4, clap, 1, ['overhead'])
MomentEnd()
MomentStart(3)
...
MomentEnd()
MomentStart(27)
BarlineEvent(3, 'end')
MomentEnd()
DeleteContext(2, 3)
