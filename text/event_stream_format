== File start
Moment 0 is assumed to be previous to anything happening. So the head,
- Assumes moment 0,
: ...so requires no wrap in MomentStart/MomentEnd
- should contain no DanceEvent(s)
: not an error, but ignored. Ignoring is not guarenteed
- Will conclude on MomentStart(1)

== File end
Moment is irrelevant. so the tail,
- Assumes no moment
: ...so requires no wrap in MomentStart/MomentEnd
- should contain no DanceEvent(s)
: not an error, but ignored. Ignoring is not guarenteed
- Must conclude on a Finish
: last command in a list of events
